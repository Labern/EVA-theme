# Custom Eva Theme

Goal: serve up an interesting EVA theme, and teach you to make your own. Thanks to the original [EVA](https://github.com/garyblocks/eva-zsh-theme) theme.

## Prerequisites: 
- Install ZSH and Oh My Zsh
- Access your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file and find the <code>THEME=""</code> line

# How to use

1. Go to <code>~/.oh-my-zsh/themes</code> and add **<code>custom.zsh-theme</code>**.
2. Open <code>~/.zshrc</code> and add <code>THEME="custom"</code>.

3. To customise, go to <code>~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/custom.zsh-theme</code>.

## Building a prompt
4. Follow the instructions inside the file, such as: <code>PROMPT="%{$fg_bold[blue]%}%n: "</code> 

In this case, it will change the prompt to the user's name in blue.

## Some prompts

### Prompt elements

<code>PROMPT=""</code> dictates the leftmost prompt

<code>RPROMPT=""</code> dictates a prompt on the right

<code>%n</code> = user

<code>%~</code> = working directory

<code>%m</code> = computer

<code>#</code> = leave a comment

### Colours
<code>%{$fg_bold[blue]%}</code> â€” that is, <code>%{</code> opens the statements, then <code>fg_bold</code> selects the formatting (in this case, bold), and <code>[blue]</code> selects the colour. So you have: "Insert bold text of colour blue".

## Notes

You may need to use <code>chmod +x ~/.zshrc</code> to be able to access it.

Also, make sure to select a text editor you like to open the files, e.g. <code>***nano*** ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/custom.zsh-theme</code>

This was built from the [EVA theme](https://github.com/garyblocks/eva-zsh-theme), and modified.

# Bonus:
Add an EVA reference by adding an alias like <code>CONFIG_EVA="nano \~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/custom.zsh-theme"</code> to <code>~/.zshrc</code> so you can run <code>CONFIG_EVA</code> to tweak it, as if you were Mistato, shouting orders at people before going back to Pen-Pen and boozin'.

# Example 

As you'll note, the line is hilariously long. The idea is to teach you how it all works so you can learn for yourself. You can even split things up onto separate lines to make something gloriously colourful.
